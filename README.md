The purpose of this website is to host data files, and python notebooks needed to create for limit plots on axions, axion-like particles and dark photons. Please email me [ciaran.aj.ohare@gmail.com] if you have any questions/comments/complaints or if you would like your limit to be added to these plots.

**Disclaimer:** the limits on this website here have been collected from an extremely wide array of papers (not all of them published) and from several different sub-fields. There may be wildly varying levels of uncertainty, assumption, model dependence, and importantly, differing levels of statistical rigour. There is not necessarily any fixed convention for what even constitutes a bound. This goes especially for experimental projections, which vary considerably in their respective levels of optimism. Therefore, one should exercise some caution when reading these plots: they are not intended to be the definitive word on the status of the axion. I more see them as a way to advertise the many ways one can search, and give a *rough* picture for what is allowed and what is ruled out. Some may see my inclusion of certain bounds as being overly democratic, however I felt that it was important for this extremely active field to be fully reflected in these plots.

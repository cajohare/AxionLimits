The purpose of this website is to host data files and python notebooks to create limit plots on axions, axion-like particles, dark photons, and other ultralight bosons. Please email me [ciaran.aj.ohare@gmail.com] if you have any questions/comments/complaints. I greatly appreciate corrections to anything here, no matter how minor or trivial. Please also inform me if a limit you have made isn't here, usually it will just be because I missed it. Also if you have made one of the limits shown here and it has been revised (e.g. in a v2 of the paper) please let me know as I am much more likely to have missed the update.

Please go to [refs/](refs/README.md) to see a full list of all references, including a .tex and .bib file with all citation details collected from Inspire.

**Disclaimer:** the limits on this website here have been collected from an extremely wide array of papers (not all of them published) and from several different sub-fields. There may be wildly varying levels of uncertainty, assumption, model dependence, and importantly, differing levels of statistical rigour. There is not necessarily any fixed convention for what even constitutes a bound. This goes especially for experimental projections, which vary considerably in their respective levels of optimism. Therefore, one should exercise some caution when reading these plots: they are not intended to be the definitive word on the status of the axion. I more see them as a way to advertise the many ways one can search, and give a *rough* picture for what is allowed, what is ruled out, and what the community in general has been up to. Some may see my inclusion of certain bounds as being overly democratic, however I felt that it was important for this extremely active field to be fully reflected in these plots.
